# code-refactoring
In  this challenge, we were given starter code. The goal of this challenge was to refactor the starter code with semantic elements and tags. Comments were also added to the code for better readability.

*Repository was given a unique name.
* The starter code was refactored with semantic elements & tags without changing the structure of the starter code.
* Title was added to the page describing what the page is about.

The images below are three screenshots of how my deployed application looks
